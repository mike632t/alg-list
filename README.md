## alg-list - The classic linked list problem.

Written in Algol 68. 

Shows how to manipulate a linked list using Algol 68.  Looking at the code 
now it doesn't seem to be nearly as difficult to understand as it was when
I first wrote it!

On VAX/VMS compile and run using:
  
    $ algol alg-list
    $ link alg-list  
    $ run alg-list
    Michael, Lisa, John, Mary, David, James, Karen, Robert, Linda, Mark, Patricia, William, Deborah, Richard, Elizabeth, 
    *** Original list
    Michael, Lisa, John, Mary, David, James, Karen, Robert, Linda, Mark, Patricia, William, Deborah, Richard, Elizabeth, 
    *** Sorted list
