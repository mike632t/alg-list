## alg-list - An array of strings.

Written in Algol 68. 

Shows how to manipulate a linked list using Algol 68.  Looking at the code 
now it doesn't seem to be nearly as difficult to understand as it was when
I first wrote it!

On VAX/VMS compile using:
  
   $ algol alg-list
   $ link alg-list
   $ run alg-list
